# PKHeX MAUI(Mobile)

This project is simply applying the public PKHeX code library to a cross platform interface. Currently this is only compiled for Android, however it is possible for a user to compile it for MACOS or IOS as well. 

Huge Thanks to all those who have contributed to PKHeX in anyway, especially but not limited to:</br>
Kurt(Kaphotics) - [original PKHeX which this project is based on](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX)</br>
Anubis(Lusamine)</br>
Architdate</br>

***AS THIS IS A SIDE PROJECT NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED ON THE PKHEX DEVELOPMENT SERVER***</br>
Please join the server below for any support needed for the app. Eventually a wiki will be added to answer common questions.
